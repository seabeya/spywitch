### FAQ

- What is it?
  > It is a tool that allows you to track users' chat messages on Twitch.tv.
- Why?
  > When doing channel moderation, there may be situations where it is necessary to monitor users/chat participants not only within the channel, but also across the platform.
- Is this legal?
  > It was made with Twitch policies in mind and does not oppose current policies.
- How does it work?
  > Twitch has some public APIs that allow you to do such things. This tool presents filtered data using some of those APIs, with a user-friendly interface.
- Why do I need to "log in with Twitch" to use it?
  > This tool is completely browser-based and takes you directly to the APIs without any intermediaries. To have direct access to the APIs from the browser, you need to authenticate with Twitch.
- What data will this tool access if I log in?
  > This tool only requires permission to "View live Stream Chat and Rooms messages". This permission allows reading public chat messages on the platform, which enables this tool to collect chat message data, which is the main logic of this tool.
- Do you collect my data?
  > No, this tool does not collect any data from you as a user. This means that we do not collect any statistics regarding who uses the tool, how they use it, or when.
- Do you store chat logs?
  > No, we do not store chat logs. This goes against Twitch's policies. The chat logs disappear when you refresh the page.
